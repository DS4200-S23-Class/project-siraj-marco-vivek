          <h2>Introduction and Motivation</h2>
          <p>MLB, the top professional baseball league in the world, has been in existence since 1903 and has featured some of the greatest players in baseball history, such as Babe Ruth, Willie Mays, and Derek Jeter. The league is renowned for its long-standing history, intense rivalries, and enthusiastic fan base, with millions of viewers tuning in to watch the games both in-person and on television. The captivating and beloved sport of baseball has won the hearts of fans worldwide with its blend of skill, athleticism, and strategy. Baseball statistics are really important to both fans and coaches. Based on Molly (2018), based on the attendance data of MLB teams from 2001 to 2016, the increase in fan experience and attendance is mostly influenced by team performance, in other words, losses and wins. From our perspective, the team performance positively correlates with player performance. Therefore, learning about  individual player performance or making comparisons between players can help baseball clubs gain a deeper insight into their fan experience. At the same time, the coach can easily understand the team performance and make key decisions, such as developing tactics and trading players. Our team aims to develop a pack of simple, clear, and efficient visualizations for MLB player statistics. </p>
          <p>This project is a dashboard for the 2022
            MLB season that allows users to see how players performed and
            compare the performance of two players. Our motivation was
            to create simple and efficient visualizations for MLB player statistics that enable users to filter, sort, navigate, and compare players.
            Through our design process, we developed a user-friendly interface
            that provides convenient access to individual player performance and
            team performance, highlighting the importance of baseball statistics
            in supporting fans and coaches. Our dashboard provides an intu-
            itive way for users to stay informed about player performance and
            make informed decisions based on data, contributing to a deeper
            understanding of the game and its players.</p>

            <h4>Data Source</h4>
            <p>Our data comes from the Kaggle dataset, 2022 MLB Player Statistics. </p>
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivovinco/2022-mlb-player-stats">Dataset</a>
            <p>This dataset contains the batting statistics for every player that participated in at least one game during the season. The data contains 29 attributes, with 26 of them being statistics, and 987 items, with each being a player. Some players appear multiple times due to changing teams throughout the season. The dataset was scraped from baseball-reference.com. Baseball Reference is a baseball statistic website used by media companies and broadcasters, providing accurate data from the 1888 season to current day.
            </p>
            
            <h4>Possible Ethical Issues and Biases</h4>
            <p>
              Baseball statistics are objective measurements of player performance on the field. They are based on the actual events during the game, such as hits, runs, and, strikeouts, and are recorded by  professionals. There are even adjustments after games to ensure accuracy.Because baseball statistics are based on actual events that happen on the field, they cannot be biased or unethical. The numbers reflect what occurred during the game and are not influenced by personal opinions, biases, or unethical practices.
            </p>
            <h4>Data Quality</h4>
            <p>The data was usable, but still needed some adjustments. The original data contained non ute-8 characters, which needed to be removed in order to process the data. Additionally, some players were listed multiple times with partial statistics because they played for different teams throughout the season.
